# RISC processor

This is vhdl simulation of 4-stage 32-bit cpu with my own instruction set.
All simulations carried out in xilinx ise.
# Structure

Consist of 4 stage pipeline, control unit, clock generator and memory bus controller. 
Pipeline contain IF (instruction fetch), ID (Instruction Decode), EX (Execute), MA (Memory Access) stages.
